The provided code is a Node.js script designed to manage GitHub repositories, specifically focusing on checking pull requests, cloning repositories, and migrating repositories and their forks from one organization to another. The script uses the Octokit library to interact with the GitHub API, allowing it to perform various operations such as fetching pull requests, listing forks, and creating new repositories.

The script begins by importing necessary modules, including Octokit for GitHub API interactions, readline for user input, and child_process for executing shell commands. It also sets up environment variables and command-line arguments to configure the GitHub token and target repository details.

The checkPRs function is responsible for fetching pull requests from the source repository and identifying forks that have open pull requests. It uses the Octokit library to make API requests to GitHub, retrieves the list of pull requests, and logs the details. It also fetches the list of forks for the repository and logs which forks have open pull requests. Forks without open pull requests are scheduled for deletion using the deleteFork function.

The deleteFork function attempts to delete a specified fork repository using the GitHub API. If the deletion is successful, it logs a message; otherwise, it logs an error.

The askQuestion function uses the readline module to prompt the user for input, allowing the script to ask for confirmation before proceeding with the migration.

The cloneRepo function clones a GitHub repository to a local directory using the git clone command. It checks if the directory already exists to avoid redundant cloning.

The pushRefs function pushes specified Git references from a local repository to a remote repository using the git push command.

The main function orchestrates the entire process. It starts by checking pull requests and asking the user for confirmation to proceed with the migration. It then clones the source repository, creates a new repository in the target organization, and pushes the references to the new repository. For each fork with open pull requests, it creates a corresponding fork in the target organization, merges the changes, and creates a pull request to integrate the fork's changes into the new repository.

Overall, the script automates the process of migrating repositories and their forks, ensuring that pull requests are preserved and integrated into the new organization. It leverages the GitHub API extensively and uses shell commands to manage Git operations.
